### Script:

#### Premise: As a hunter, viewing the information our harvests provide the Department of Conservation is both important and interesting. I have using the annual harvest reports to create maps, and visualize data before. I find them cool to look at, but thats about it. This project was create to show how you can display the data to use as an informative tool in viewing trands in population, and deer presence 


Line 1: Welcome to Geography 575, I am Virginia Robenski.  

Line 2: So, I live in New York State, and about 6 years ago I started learning how to hunt. Both on private and public lands in New York State.

Line 3: New York state's Department of Conservation manages our hunging regulations and out puts reports on their findings every hunting season.

Line 4:  I have found their reports interesting, and the maps they make as helpful as they can be. But there are multiple pages, to show the data, making it hard to follow trends that the maps can show.

Line 5:  I wanted to use this project as a way to create an application that hunters like myself can use to identify trands in hunting population over time. Whether it be for looking for locations to hunt, or strictly for informational purposes. 

Line 6 - HOME WMUS - This first page shows the WMUs for New York State, and what their unit name is. This side panel provides information about the web application, as well as information about the sources.


Line 7: Deer Harvest & Deer Harvest Total - This tab shows the deer harvest each year from 1988 through 2023 per WMU. Using the Drop down you can filter through Adult Male, Female, and Fawn harvest estimations. The Side panel provides more information. 

Line 8: Bear Harvest tabs -  The Bear Harvest Report tabs show similar information from 1970 through 2023, for bears. 


Line 9: Bear Harvest Method - This tab shows harvest method by township in New Yorlk State. This information would be extremely useful for a hunter using this page to decide where they could have the most success, depending on regulation.

Line 10: This web application is a great way to show how hunting data can be used in a dynamic and informative way.

Line 11: Happy Hunting!
